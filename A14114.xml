            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The building is ſcarce finiſhed, but it is readie to totter, and to fall, and ſure it is ere long to fal. Man is ſcarce entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde, when as hée is admoniſhed to remember his departure out of the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

Therefore the ſumme of our yéeres, whereunto all do not attaine, is theéeſcore yéeres and ten; the ſtronger bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſometimes continue till fourſcore. From which yéeres, firſt of all we do deduct thoſe yéeres which Infancie &amp; childhood ſpendeth: for all that time we liue not like men, neither are gouerned with a certaine violent motion <hi>like vnto bruite beaſtes, which are deuoide of reaſon and vnderſtanding.</hi> If alſo we take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that time which paſſeth away when we fléep (for ſléeping, we liue not the life of beaſts when they wake, much leſſe of men) and that time will rather ſéeme a liuing death, then a liuely life. If, I ſay, we deduct all the time of childhood and ſléep, that which remaineth wil ſcarcely amount to fortie yéeres: And of theſe fortie yéeres, we haue not one moment of time in ſuch wiſe in our power, that we can aſſuredly ſay, that we ſhall not die therein. For whether we eate, drinke, or ſléepe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be in labor, or in reſt, we are alwaies in perils.

Yea we finde daily in our ſelues, by experience, that the forgetfulnes of death, makes vs applie our heartes to follie, and all kinde of vanity. The holy men of olde time, were wont in ſuch wiſe to kéepe an account of their dayes, that aboue all things they might apply their hearts to wiſedome. Of all Arithmeticall Rules this is the hardeſt, to number our dayes. Men can number their heardes, and droues of oxen, and of ſhéepe:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6372:19"/> they can account the reuenues of theyr man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp; farmes: they can with a little paines number and tell their coyne: and yet they are perſwaded that their dayes are infinite and innumerable, and therefore doo neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to number them. Who ſaith not vpon the viewe of another, ſurely yonder man looketh by his countenance as if he would not liue long? or, yonder woman is olde, her dayes cannot be many.

Therefore this is the true wiſedome of mortall men, to number theyr owne dayes: and like ſkilfull <hi>Geometricians,</hi> to meaſure all theyr actions, all their ſtudies, all theyr cares, all their thoughtes, all theyr deſires, and all theyr counſells, by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this life, as by the end whereto they are referred, as it were by a certaine rule, and thereunto to direct all things: and ſo to finiſh the courſe of our life which God hath giuen vnto vs, that at the laſt we may come to the happy hauen of reſt.</p>

                  <hi>13</hi> But yet notwithſtanding, euery man feareth much more when he beginneth to conſider what condition remaineth for the ſoule.

What if we had dyed in the daies if our ignorance, like <hi>Iudas</hi> that hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before he could ſée the paſſion, reſurection, or aſcenſion of Chriſt Ieſus? we ſhould haue numbred our dayes and our ſins too: but alas how many dayes haue we ſpent, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought why any day was giuen vs? but as the old yeare went, and a new come, ſo we thought that a new would follow that: and ſo wee thinke that an other will followe this: and God knoweth how ſoone we ſhal be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for ſo they thought too, that are now in their graues. O deare brethren, this is not to number our dayes, but to prouoke God to ſhorten our dayes; I that writ this, thou that readeſt this, &amp; all you that heare this, which of vs haue not liued twenty yeares, yea and ſome thirty or forty, and happily ſome many more; and yet we haue neuer applyed our hearts aright vnto wiſdome. O if wee had learned but euery yeare one vertue ſince we were borne, we might by this time haue bin like ſaints among men; whereas if God at this preſent time ſhould cal vs to iudgement, it would appeare that we had applyed our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6372:28"/> heartes, our mindes, our hands, and féet, or tongues: yea &amp; our whole bodies to riches &amp; pleaſures, to lying and deceiuing, to ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and forſwearing, yea and to all kinde of ſin and wickedneſſe, but to true vertue and wiſdome, we haue not applyed our heartes. God of his mery giue vs grace to ſée our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins, truly to repent vs of them, and to amend our liues hereafter, that we may liue with him for euer. Surely if man could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe that this were his laſt day, as it may be if God ſo pleaſe, he would not defer his repentance vntil to morrow. If he could thinke that this is his laſt meat that euer he ſhal eate, he would not ſurfet: if he could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that the words which he doth ſpeake to day, ſhould be the laſt words that euer hee ſhould ſpeake, he would not offend with his tongue in lying, ſwearing, and blaſpheming: if he could be perſwaded that this were the laſt leſſon, the laſt admonition, or the laſt ſermon that euer God would affoord him to cal him to repentance, hee would reade it, or heare it, with more diligence then euer he hath done before. O I beſéech you remember your ſelues while it is to day, leſt you repent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6372:28"/> your ſelues when it is too late: of all we that be here, which of vs can aſſure our ſelues of life til to morrow? or what if we ſhould liue thrée, foure, or fiue yeares, or what if twenty yeares, who would not liue like a chriſtian twenty yeares, to liue in heauen with Chriſt eternally? we can be content to ſerue ſeauen yeares prentiſe, with great labour and toyle, to be inſtructed in ſome trade that we may liue the more eaſily the reſt of our dayes, and we muſt labour notwithſtanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and can we not be content to labour in the things of God a little while, that wée may reſt from our labours euer after. Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples when he found them ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, could yée not watch one houre? ſo I ſay vnto you, and to my ſelfe, can we not pray, can we not faſt? can wee not ſuffer a little while? he which is tyred, can trauaile a little further, one ſteppe more to ſaue his life: and therefore God would not haue men knowe when they ſhall dye, becauſe they ſhould make ready at all times, hauing no more certainty of one houre then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

For as the Scripture teſtifieth, the feare of the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth ſinne, and he which is without feare cannot he iuſtified.<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioan. Tract. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> The which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by a very proper ſimilitude ſetteth foorth: <hi>If there be no feare, there is no entrance for loue:</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſée when a man ſoweth, the thréed is brought in with a néedle, the néedle firſt entereth, but except the néedle goe out alſo, the thréed followeth not: Euen ſo, feare firſt poſſeſſeth the minde, but feare remaineth not there alone, becauſe it therefore entred to bring in loue. Wherefore to awake vs ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6372:30"/> in ſinnes, and to ingender feare in our minds, the Lord doth oftentimes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel threaten vtter darknes, gnaſhing of teeth, euerlaſting fire, and other torments of hell, that at the leaſtwiſe for feare of paines and torments, we might bridle our mindes, our eyes, and our hands, from ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This feare is not onely probable, but alſo very neceſſarie. For if now after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny threatnings of our Creator, ſo fearefull and ſo greeuous, we ſcarcely forſake our ſins, what would we do if God did not threaten at all? Therefore I holde this, that the feare of the Lord is, as it were, the parent and kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of righteouſneſſe, temperance, loue, and of all vertues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But there is nothing that doeth more worke this feare in vs, then the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that great day, wherein al the cauſes of al men are to be pleaded, and their matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Inſomuch that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth, if Chriſtian men ſhould heare no other Goſpel then that wherein the general iudgement is ſet foorth, that one might ſuffice both to reuoke ſinnefull men from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, and alſo being reuoked, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine them in their dutie.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:6372:31"/>4 Wherefore, in this Chapter wée will handle two notable points concerning the iudgement to come. The firſt ſhal be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the greatnes &amp; horror of that day, and of the fearefull ſignes that ſhall go before the ſame. The ſecond ſhalbe concerning the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp of the dead bodies, and the comming of the Iudge.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The greatneſſe and horror of that laſt day may be knowen hereby, that it is called in holy Scripture, a great day, and the day of the Lord. And ſhall it not indéede be a very great day, which ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend all the daies of all ages, aſwell thoſe that are paſt, as thoſe that are to come? For in that day men ſhall render an account of all the dayes that are paſt. In that day God will poure out that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treaſure of his wrath and indignation, which he hath heaped vp in the ſpace of al the worlds that are paſt. In that day the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heauens ſhall ceaſe, the courſe of the ſtarres, the reuolution of yéeres, the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude or returne of moneths and dayes, the decay of mortal things, al the cogitations of men, al their ſtudies, al their Artes, al their diſciplines, all their affaires, ſhall reſt in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſilence.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Alſo in that day it ſhal be decréed by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6372:31"/> the ſentence and irreuocable conſtitution of the moſt high and eternal Iudge, what ſtate and condition euery one of vs ſhall haue and retaine in al eternitie of worlds.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And not without cauſe the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue called it the day of the Lord. For as al the dayes of men going before, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their dayes, becauſe men watch in them, and do whatſoeuer they will: and God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſuffereth, endureth, expecteth, and after a ſort, ſleepeth &amp; reſteth in them: Euen ſo then, the day of the Lorde ſhal ſhine, wherein hée ſhal be continually waking &amp; ſhal do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he wil, and we (whether we wil or no) muſt ſuffer and endure.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Thou now doeſt adde ſin vnto ſinnes, and ceaſeſt not to offend God dayly: &amp; God is ſilent at al theſe things. And why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this day is thy day: But the day ſhall come, beléeue me, the day of the Lorde ſhall come, which ſhal bring an ende to ſo long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and wherein he wil take vengeaunce of all the iniuries that haue béene done vnto him.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Thus we ſée that al Eternitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth two dayes onely: The one of man, the other of God. In the one, men ſhal watch, and God ſhal ſleepe; In the other,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6372:32"/> men ſhal ſleepe, and God ſhal watch.</p>
               <p n="10">10 How horrible this day ſhall bée, wée cannot plainly vnderſtand, and yet we may geſſe at it by the preſent calamities: For then the hoaſt of al puniſhments, which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate battel of al offences, ſhal aſſaile vs with maine force.</p>
               <p n="11">11 But as in the warres of men, before the laſt and general battel, there are many excurſions, and ſhort ſkirmiſhes: euen ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great and moſt fearefull conflict, which ſhalbe in the day of the Lorde, God is wont with his ſeueral bands to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine excurſions, and one while to ſend vpon vs famine, another while peſtilence, another while warre, another while earth-quakes, another while floods of waters, and another while drougth, as it were his horſemen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade vs, who when they haue damnified vs, retire and abide in their tents. If therefore, we ſo greatly feare peſtilence, warre, famine, earth-quakes, and ſuch like, when as they are but the beginning of ſorrowes and ſhort excurſions, what I pray you, wil wée doe, when the laſt and general conflict ſhal come? at what time al tribulations, extremities, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and miſeries, ſhal alſo fight againſt vs?</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:6372:32"/>12 And if wée doe yet more fully deſire to know the greatnes and horror of that laſt day, let vs conſider thoſe ſignes which ſhal a little while come before that day.

               <p n="14">14 When a tempeſt ariſeth at the Sea, and the boiſterous waues begin to toſſe and beat the ſhippe, and the men which are in the ſame do beholde the horrible lightnings and fierie flaſhings in the ayre, and the furious winds alſo, making the ſea to ſwel and rage, in ſuch wiſe, that now they ſée themſelues toſſed aloft, and then anon caried down into the déepe: they begin preſently to cry, to feare, to tremble, to call for mercie, to multiplie their prayers, to craue time of repentance, to commend their ſaluation to almightie God: and to be ſhort, they begin to thinke of the amendement of their manners, and to haue better purpoſes. Then thinke with thy ſelfe what manner of minde men wil haue, when

               <p n="29">29 It ſéemed not a hard and ſtraite way to the Apoſtles of our Lord: It ſéemed not ſo to them which ſuccéeded them in profeſſion, who forſooke all that they poſſeſſed, &amp; would néedes follow poore <hi>Chriſt</hi> in pouertie. For it cannot bée expreſſed in wordes how ample and large the way of the Lorde ſhal be made vnto all them, which can ſet their heart vpon Heauen, contemne earthly vanities, with great feruencie of minde to cleaue whollie vnto God, and which can cut off the deſires of vnprofitable things.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Laſt of all this may be added alſo for the explication of our queſtion, that the lawe and commandementes of God are a ſtraite way and gate, if they be conſidered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and alone. But if the grace and helpe of God be ioyned vnto them, they ought not to be called a ſtraite gate, but a ſwéete yoke and a light burthen.</p>
               <p n="31">31 For this is the difference betwéene the law and the Goſpel. The law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that wee ſhould bée holie, but it gaue no grace by which men are ſanctified: It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to fight againſt the deuill, but it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6372:62"/> gaue not vnto vs neceſſary armor and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to fight: It commanded vs of carnall to become ſpiritual, but it gaue not the holy Ghoſt by which we might be made ſpiritual: It commanded vs to goe forward towardes Heauen, but it giueth not vnto vs Ladders and ſteppes by which wée may aſcend into Heauen.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Therefore the Law was a yoke, but not a ſwéete yoke: It was a burthen, but not a light one. But the Goſpel comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſelfe-ſame things, giueth helpe and ſtrength, that they may not onely bée done, but alſo that they may be eaſily done.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Wherefore the Goſpel is a yoke, but ſweete: It is a burthen, but light. It is alſo a ſtrait and a broad way: it is a ſharpe, and pleaſant way. Let vs heare the words of the Prophet ſaying, <hi>Becauſe of the words of thy mouth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>I haue kept hard wayes.</hi> Beholde a yoke and a burthen, a ſtrait and a narrowe way. Let vs heare the ſame Prophet again: <hi>In the way of thy Commandements I haue had as great delight, as in in all manner of riches.</hi> Againe, <hi>I haue runne the way of thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, when thou haſt ſet my heart at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Behold a helpe of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For then the way is inlarged, and the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6372:62"/> courſe eaſily finiſhed, when the heart is made ſpatious &amp; voyd with the fire of loue: What is the cauſe that all the ſaintes did ſo great and wonderfull workes, and wee ſo ſmall, and the ſame not without the compulſion of law many times? Surely there is no other cauſe but this: they were feruent, and we are colde. Finally they which complaine of the ſtraitnes of the Lordes wayes, ſéeme to mee not to haue knowne as yet what the Goſpel ſignifieth. For what doth the goſpel ſignifie? what grace? what the Law of loue? what the holy Ghoſt? what Chriſt? what Ieſus? and what a deliuer? but a deliuerance, but liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and charitie, but ſwéetneſſe, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie?</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the diuell had not blinded them, ſo as they might ſée ſinne in her colours, ſhe would ſéem ſuch a deformed monſter, as they would loathe her for euer. For her eyes are ful of Adultrie: her eares are very large and great, open to heare all vaine delights: her tongue ſwollen with lying and deceit: her throate is an open ſepulchre: her lippes are boulſtred vp with the poyſon of Aſpes: her hands are large to receiue bribes: her belly hath a tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie

               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Not only the ſcriptures, but that moſt excellent and comely order, by which we ſée ſo many ſeuerall things gouerned, being ſo different, ſo diuers, and ſo diſagréeing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in places, doth proue vnto vs, that all things in the world, are gouerned and ruled, not by fortune and chance, but by the prouidence of God. Euen as, if thou heare a harpe ſound pleaſantly, or if thou ſée a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon or a ſhip to goe forward by arte, reaſon, and order, although thou ſée not the harper, wagoner, or maiſter of the ſhip, yet thou art out of doubt, that there is a harper which cauſeth the hary to ſound in good tune, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6372:95"/> and a ſhipmaiſter, which maketh both the wagon and ſhip, to moue and goe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 We are two maner of waies afflicted by God. For ſometimes we are troubled by thoſe things, which without any fault of their owne, doe hurt vs: and ſometime by thoſe things, which hurt vs not without their fault and ſinne. The firſt followe the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which it is ordained that among mortall creatures, the weaker ſhal alwaies giue place vnto the ſtronger. The other doe breake the lawe of God. As when we ſuffer and ſuſtaine any thing at the hands of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, God hath a worke therein, ſo farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth as it may be to our good, and therefore ſuffereth the euil to be done, drawing out of the euil a greater good.</p>
               <p n="7">7 For God is ſaid to work in that which is good: for there is nothing ſo euill, which hath not ſome good ioyned with it. And there is no good ſo ſmall, whereof God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not make a bottomleſſe fountaine, and as it were an Ocean of all good things. As for example, behold a lame man. What is it to halt? To halt, is to walke: but yet, not without a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie. To walke is good, but the maladie is euil: Whereof or from whence hath the man that walking which is good? From y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6372:96"/> of his wil and mouing inſtrument of the mind. From whence commeth the maladie? commeth it from his will? No verily: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſhortneſſe, or crookedneſſe of his legge, or from ſuch like cauſe. After the ſame maner, a théefe ſtretcheth forth his hand, he ſhaketh his ſword, and it is of God, and is good. But to kill him whom he ſhould not, is euill, and commeth from the wicked wil of man, which God neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelleth, nor moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, nor helpeth to euill: and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſuffereth that to be done, which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Thus then we ſée how farre God hath his worke in the ſinnes of men, in ſuffering them to be done. And although it is in him not to ſuffer euil, the which without his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance coulde not bée, yet notwithſtanding (that I may vſe Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words) hee thinketh it better to drawe that wich is good from euill, then not to ſuffer any euill at all. For God would not ſuffer any ſinne to be, if hée were not ſo mighty, ſo prudent, and ſo good, that both hée knoweth how, and alſo can and wil out of ſinne, worke greater good.</p>
               <p n="8">8 What greater euill could there be, then ſo many Prophets, ſo many Apoſtles, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Martirs, and Chriſt himſelfe to be ſlaine?
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6372:96"/> Could not God haue hindred this? No doubt moſt eaſily: but he would not. By which we ſée how great glary &amp; felicity he hath brought to them that ſuffered: how great honour and praiſe they haue yéelded to God, for whome they ſuffered, and how great profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie their deathes and ſufferings hath brought to the whole world. Neither did the Church at any time ſuffer the perſecutions of the heathen, but it was thereby made the better, the more vigilant, the more glorious, and like gold, which comming out of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, is more fine and pure.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The other cauſe of all our calamities, miſeries, and afflictions of this life is ſinne. By reaſon wherof, ſo ſoone as we are borne, wée bring with vs the ſentence of death. Much like vnto thoſe ſicke men, of whoſe life the phyſitians hauing no hope, do onely for a time maintaine life with preſeruatiues, that ſo a little while he may linger to make his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and then depart.

For in ſuffering of aduerſities, we learn how great the corruption of our nature is, which being touched with any aduerſity, ſtraight way (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the holy Ghoſt helpe) breaketh forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to murmurings, grudgings, and into blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and complaints againſt the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.

But the light of the holy Ghoſt had no ſooner illumined him, but how did he plucke vp his ſpirits againe? Howe godly and rightly doth he iudge of God? The crookednes of our nature is hidden from vs: for the heart of man is vnſearcheable. But

               <p n="18">18 The triall alſo (before ſpoken of) bringeth hope.

We muſt haue a ſorrow and vnfeined grief, for that we haue offended <hi>God,</hi> for that wée haue before times wickedly abuſed our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, redemption, and Baptiſme, for that wée haue prouoked <hi>God</hi> with all our members, for that we haue abuſed our vnderſtanding, heart, tongue, féete, and hands: for that wée haue giuen and ſet foorth our ſoules and bodies (which are the Temples wherein <hi>God</hi> would dwell) to infidelitie, idolatrie, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, filthineſſe, blaſphemie, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, extortion, vſurie, robberie, gluttonie, drunkenneſſe, ambition, exceſſe, ryot, &amp; other worldly vanities, which is aſmuch as if we would haue lodged <hi>God</hi> the father, the ſonne, and the Ghoſt, in a moſt ſtinking and filthy
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6372:122"/> priuie. Wée muſt therefore bée ſorry for our wicked life paſſed, vſing a true and ſeuere examining of our ſelues, which may bring foorth in vs a diſpleaſantneſſe and horrour of our forepaſſed renting and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by al manner of meanes of the Lawe of God, to follow the will of the Diuell, of the world, and of the fleſh. Nowe the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the breade of the Supper (which is omitted in the Paſſeouer of the Papiſts) ſhould cauſe vs to acknowledge and deteſt our wickedneſſe, that is to ſay, whatſoeuer is founde in vs, contrary and repugnant to the pure and holy Lawe of <hi>GOD.</hi> For, in that, that the bread is broken for vs, or rather in that, that wée breake the bread of the Supper of our Lorde <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> it ſignifieth vnto vs, that in déede it is we, that it is our ſinnes and iniquities, which haue crucified and put to death the Lorde of life, who is the very ſame <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Lorde, So that wée muſt not doe, as in times paſſed the Infidels did, which made great lamentations and inuectiues againſt the Iewes, <hi>Pontius Pilate, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, Iudas,</hi> and them that had executed and put <hi>Chriſt</hi> to death, and in the meane ſeaſon flattered themſelues: vaunting of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6372:122"/> their owne merites and deſertes, and did not narrowly conſider, that <hi>Iudas, Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pilate, Herode,</hi> were but executers and miniſters of their impieties and ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore conſider in the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the breade, that our ſinnes, yea, the ſinnes of euery one of vs ſeuerally, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the ſonne of <hi>God,</hi> and brake him with the ſorrowes of the firſt and ſecond death, as namely the wordes of the Supper doe ſhew, that the body of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for vs, and his blood was ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes.

Not ſo: but wée muſt deteſt it, as that, that before time ſeparated vs from <hi>God</hi> our chiefeſt happineſſe: as that, that cauſed vs to looſe the image and ſimilitude of <hi>God,</hi> according to which wée were created at the beginning by <hi>GOD.</hi> It is that, that hath wholy deſtroyed vs, that hath depriued vs of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, that hath bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vs out of Paradice, that hath made vs ſlaues to the tyranny of the Diuell, that hath made vs ſubiect to ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and diſeaſes: and to be ſhort, both to the firſt &amp; ſecond death.

                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:6372:123"/> which was before moſt pleaſant and louing vnto vs. It is that, wherby the wrath of God is heaped vpon men: that maketh the earth to become barren, &amp; to bring forth thornes and thiſtles: that cauſes women to bring forth in ſorrow, and that men eate their bread in the ſweat &amp; labour of their bodies. Séeing then that ſinne bringeth forth, and procureth vnto vs daily ſo many miſeries: it followeth that we ought to withdrawe our ſelues from it, if we wil not be wilful enemies of our owne happineſſe &amp; ſaluation. Now then, I cite here all diſordered and ſlanderous perſons, which notwithſtnading are ſo impudent to preſent themſelues to the Lords holy Table. I aſke them what it is that they promiſed to God &amp; his Church in Baptiſme? They wil anſwere me, that they promiſed God to renounce the Diuel &amp; all his workes. But one of the chiefe and principall workes of the Diuel, is ſinne. Why doe they not then abſtaine from it? Why are they traytours, and diſobedient to God &amp; his Church? Why haue they conſpired with the Diuel, the world, &amp; the fleſh, againſt their own ſaluation? How dare they peeſent themſelues before God, to aſke him pardon and remiſſion of their ſins: ſéeing that more and more they heape ſin vpon ſin, &amp; crucifie &amp;

Put the caſe that a wicked man, poore, and deſtitute of all helpe, wete fallen into a mire, whence out he could by no meanes rayſe vp himſelfe, &amp; that ſome young Prince paſſing that way, tooke the paines to draw him out of the ditch, to make him cleane, to cloath him with gorgious and precious apparell: if this wicked man, &amp; poore miſerable caytife, fall againe into this myre wilfully by his own folly, &amp; beray both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe &amp; his apparell, being moreouer in great daunger of his life: would not one think that this man were maruellouſly vnkind, and a contemner of that princely bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; on the other ſide, a wilful and ſworne enemy of his owne health, worthy to be loſt and caſt away without any helpe or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?

But here muſt we diligently marke the pointes that followe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this acknowledging muſt be made to one onely God, by his onely ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. For euen as God by his onely ſonne hath created vs, &amp; redéemd vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting death: ſo wil he that to him alone, and by him alone, in whom he is well pleaſed, we render thanks for all his benefits.

               <p>And therefore renouncing our ſelues and euery liuing creature, let vs ſay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Vnto the king euerlaſting, immortall,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17</note> inuiſible, vnto God only wiſe, be honour and glory for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thanks muſt be giuen, not with the mouth onely: but with the hart alſo. For, ſéeing that God is a ſpirit, he requireth a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of vs, that is agréeable to his nature: that is to ſay, he will be ſerued of vs in ſpirit and truth. And therefore, when that prayſing of God for the benefit of redemption, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in queſtion, we muſt haue our hearts lift vp on high, and there muſt be a conſent and mutuall agréement betwéen our inward affections and our tongues, as we ſée how <hi>Dauid</hi> exhorteth himſelfe to the ſame, when he ſaith, My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord, and all that is within mee praiſe his holy name.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:6372:130"/> they that ſing and praiſe in an vnknowne tongue, are here reproued. For where there is no vnderſtanding, there is no affection nor wil, and conſequently no faith, without which, whatſoeuer we doe, bee it neuer ſo faire and glorious before men, it is but ſinne and abhomination before God. Let vs take héede therefore that in this behalfe we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, and goe aſtray, leaſt we be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Iewiſh people, which honoured and ſerued God in vaine, inſomuch as they came neare vnto him onely with their mouthes,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, it muſt be done at all times and ſeaſons,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.1</note> that is to ſay aſwel in affliction, as in proſperity: &amp; to this purpoſe <hi>Dauid</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, That he will alwaies giue thanks vnto his Lord,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18.</note> and that his prayſe ſhall be in his month continually. And <hi>Saint Paul</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> To giue thanks in all things: adding, For this is the wil of God in Chriſt Ieſus. But this is cleane contrarie to time ſeruers, and to all them which in time of proſperity lawn vpon the Goſpell, and are wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent for that time to praiſe God, whom afterward in time of affliction they defie and ſet at naught.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:6372:130"/>
               <p>The cauſe of this miſchiefe is, for that they haue not yéelded themſelues to the Church of GOD, for a good end and purpoſe, as to extoll the glory of God, to ſéeke their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and the ſaluation of their brethren, but rather to make themſelues greater in their goods and honours, and to ſatiſfie their owne affections. And therefore it commeth to paſſe, that as ſoone as the diuell lifteth vp his hornes againſt the Church of God, and perſecutions be at hand, they melt away by and by in afflictions, as doth waxe before the fire: they are offended, and parched with the Sunne of the croſſe, they are ſorie for the good they haue done, they repent themſelues that they were ſo haſty to confeſſe the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the aſſembly of the faithful, they wiſh they had neuer known GOD, nor his word, nor his Church, nor his Miniſters, becauſe they make greater account (as <hi>Eſau</hi> did) of one meſſe of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,<note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ge.</hi> 25.38</note> than of the birth-right and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the heauenly father. But let ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons knowe, that it ſhall no more profit them, that they made a faire begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and iolly holding vp of their buckler: then it did <hi>Cain, Eſau, Saule, Iudas.</hi> For ſéeing that ſentence is generall, that whoſoeuer
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6372:131"/> continueth vnto the end, he ſhall be ſaued: it followeth by the contrary, that all they which doe not continue conſtantly in the confeſſion of the ſonne of God, &amp; are hindered by their goods and honours, loue of the world, eaſe of their fleſh, to ſet forth and declare with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall traine, the benefit of our redemption: it followeth (I ſay) that ſuch perſons ſhal goe to ruine and euerlaſting deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, this acknowledging muſt not onely be priuate, but publike, in the face and preſence of the whole Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,<note n="r" place="margin">
