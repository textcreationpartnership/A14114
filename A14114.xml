            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O deare brethren, this is not to number our dayes, but to prouoke God to Å¿horten our dayes; I that writ this, thou that readeÅ¿t this, &amp; all you that heare this, which of vs haue not liued twenty yeares, yea and Å¿ome thirty or forty, and happily Å¿ome many more; and yet we haue neuer applyed our hearts aright vnto wiÅ¿dome. O if wee had learned but euery yeare one vertue Å¿ince we were borne, we might by this time haue bin like Å¿aints among men; whereas if God at this preÅ¿ent time Å¿hould cal vs to iudgement, it would appeare that we had applyed our

God of his mery giue vs grace to Å¿Ã©e our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Å¿ins, truly to repent vs of them, and to amend our liues hereafter, that we may liue with him for euer. Surely if man could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade himÅ¿elfe that this were his laÅ¿t day, as it may be if God Å¿o pleaÅ¿e, he would not defer his repentance vntil to morrow. If he could thinke that this is his laÅ¿t meat that euer he Å¿hal eate, he would not Å¿urfet: if he could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lÃ©eue that the words which he doth Å¿peake to day, Å¿hould be the laÅ¿t words that euer hee Å¿hould Å¿peake, he would not offend with his tongue in lying, Å¿wearing, and blaÅ¿pheming: if he could be perÅ¿waded that this were the laÅ¿t leÅ¿Å¿on, the laÅ¿t admonition, or the laÅ¿t Å¿ermon that euer God would affoord him to cal him to repentance, hee would reade it, or heare it, with more diligence then euer he hath done before. O I beÅ¿Ã©ech you remember your Å¿elues while it is to day, leÅ¿t you repent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6372:28"/> your Å¿elues when it is too late: of all we that be here, which of vs can aÅ¿Å¿ure our Å¿elues of life til to morrow? or what if we Å¿hould liue thrÃ©e, foure, or fiue yeares, or what if twenty yeares, who would not liue like a chriÅ¿tian twenty yeares, to liue in heauen with ChriÅ¿t eternally? we can be content to Å¿erue Å¿eauen yeares prentiÅ¿e, with great labour and toyle, to be inÅ¿tructed in Å¿ome trade that we may liue the more eaÅ¿ily the reÅ¿t of our dayes, and we muÅ¿t labour notwithÅ¿tanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and can we not be content to labour in the things of God a little while, that wÃ©e may reÅ¿t from our labours euer after.

                  </note> The which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> by a very proper Å¿imilitude Å¿etteth foorth: <hi>If there be no feare, there is no entrance for loue:</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as we Å¿Ã©e when a man Å¿oweth, the thrÃ©ed is brought in with a nÃ©edle, the nÃ©edle firÅ¿t entereth, but except the nÃ©edle goe out alÅ¿o, the thrÃ©ed followeth not: Euen Å¿o, feare firÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿eth the minde, but feare remaineth not there alone, becauÅ¿e it therefore entred to bring in loue. Wherefore to awake vs Å¿lÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6372:30"/> in Å¿innes, and to ingender feare in our minds, the Lord doth oftentimes in the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel threaten vtter darknes, gnaÅ¿hing of teeth, euerlaÅ¿ting fire, and other torments of hell, that at the leaÅ¿twiÅ¿e for feare of paines and torments, we might bridle our mindes, our eyes, and our hands, from Å¿inne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This feare is not onely probable, but alÅ¿o very neceÅ¿Å¿arie. For if now after Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny threatnings of our Creator, Å¿o fearefull and Å¿o greeuous, we Å¿carcely forÅ¿ake our Å¿ins, what would we do if God did not threaten at all? Therefore I holde this, that the feare of the Lord is, as it were, the parent and kÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, temperance, loue, and of all vertues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But there is nothing that doeth more worke this feare in vs, then the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of that great day, wherein al the cauÅ¿es of al men are to be pleaded, and their matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. InÅ¿omuch that Saint <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> affirmeth, if ChriÅ¿tian men Å¿hould heare no other GoÅ¿pel then that wherein the general iudgement is Å¿et foorth, that one might Å¿uffice both to reuoke Å¿innefull men from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿es, and alÅ¿o being reuoked, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>teine them in their dutie.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:6372:31"/>4 Wherefore, in this Chapter wÃ©e will handle two notable points concerning the iudgement to come.

The Å¿econd Å¿halbe concerning the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing vp of the dead bodies, and the comming of the Iudge.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The greatneÅ¿Å¿e and horror of that laÅ¿t day may be knowen hereby, that it is called in holy Scripture, a great day, and the day of the Lord. And Å¿hall it not indÃ©ede be a very great day, which Å¿hal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>prehend all the daies of all ages, aÅ¿well thoÅ¿e that are paÅ¿t, as thoÅ¿e that are to come? For in that day men Å¿hall render an account of all the dayes that are paÅ¿t. In that day God will poure out that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treaÅ¿ure of his wrath and indignation, which he hath heaped vp in the Å¿pace of al the worlds that are paÅ¿t. In that day the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heauens Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e, the courÅ¿e of the Å¿tarres, the reuolution of yÃ©eres, the viciÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itude or returne of moneths and dayes, the decay of mortal things, al the cogitations of men, al their Å¿tudies, al their Artes, al their diÅ¿ciplines, all their affaires, Å¿hall reÅ¿t in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Å¿ilence.</p>
               <p n="6">6 AlÅ¿o in that day it Å¿hal be decrÃ©ed by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6372:31"/> the Å¿entence and irreuocable conÅ¿titution of the moÅ¿t high and eternal Iudge, what Å¿tate and condition euery one of vs Å¿hall haue and retaine in al eternitie of worlds.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And not without cauÅ¿e the holy Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue called it the day of the Lord. For as al the dayes of men going before, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their dayes, becauÅ¿e men watch in them, and do whatÅ¿oeuer they will: and God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Å¿uffereth, endureth, expecteth, and after a Å¿ort, Å¿leepeth &amp; reÅ¿teth in them: Euen Å¿o then, the day of the Lorde Å¿hal Å¿hine, wherein hÃ©e Å¿hal be continually waking &amp; Å¿hal do whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he wil, and we (whether we wil or no) muÅ¿t Å¿uffer and endure.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Thou now doeÅ¿t adde Å¿in vnto Å¿innes, and ceaÅ¿eÅ¿t not to offend God dayly: &amp; God is Å¿ilent at al theÅ¿e things. And why Å¿o? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e this day is thy day: But the day Å¿hall come, belÃ©eue me, the day of the Lorde Å¿hall come, which Å¿hal bring an ende to Å¿o long Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and wherein he wil take vengeaunce of all the iniuries that haue bÃ©ene done vnto him.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Thus we Å¿Ã©e that al Eternitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth two dayes onely: The one of man, the other of God. In the one, men Å¿hal watch, and God Å¿hal Å¿leepe; In the other,

               <p n="10">10 How horrible this day Å¿hall bÃ©e, wÃ©e cannot plainly vnderÅ¿tand, and yet we may geÅ¿Å¿e at it by the preÅ¿ent calamities: For then the hoaÅ¿t of al puniÅ¿hments, which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate battel of al offences, Å¿hal aÅ¿Å¿aile vs with maine force.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6372:95"/> and a Å¿hipmaiÅ¿ter, which maketh both the wagon and Å¿hip, to moue and goe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 We are two maner of waies afflicted by God. For Å¿ometimes we are troubled by thoÅ¿e things, which without any fault of their owne, doe hurt vs: and Å¿ometime by thoÅ¿e things, which hurt vs not without their fault and Å¿inne. The firÅ¿t followe the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which it is ordained that among mortall creatures, the weaker Å¿hal alwaies giue place vnto the Å¿tronger. The other doe breake the lawe of God. As when we Å¿uffer and Å¿uÅ¿taine any thing at the hands of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, God hath a worke therein, Å¿o farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth as it may be to our good, and therefore Å¿uffereth the euil to be done, drawing out of the euil a greater good.</p>
               <p n="7">7 For God is Å¿aid to work in that which is good: for there is nothing Å¿o euill, which hath not Å¿ome good ioyned with it. And there is no good Å¿o Å¿mall, whereof God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not make a bottomleÅ¿Å¿e fountaine, and as it were an Ocean of all good things. As for example, behold a lame man. What is it to halt? To halt, is to walke: but yet, not without a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie. To walke is good, but the maladie is euil: Whereof or from whence hath the man that walking which is good? From y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power

No verily: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Å¿hortneÅ¿Å¿e, or crookedneÅ¿Å¿e of his legge, or from Å¿uch like cauÅ¿e. After the Å¿ame maner, a thÃ©efe Å¿tretcheth forth his hand, he Å¿haketh his Å¿word, and it is of God, and is good. But to kill him whom he Å¿hould not, is euill, and commeth from the wicked wil of man, which God neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pelleth, nor moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, nor helpeth to euill: and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uffereth that to be done, which he deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Thus then we Å¿Ã©e how farre God hath his worke in the Å¿innes of men, in Å¿uffering them to be done.

For God would not Å¿uffer any Å¿inne to be, if hÃ©e were not Å¿o mighty, Å¿o prudent, and Å¿o good, that both hÃ©e knoweth how, and alÅ¿o can and wil out of Å¿inne, worke greater good.</p>

But here muÅ¿t we diligently marke the pointes that followe.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, this acknowledging muÅ¿t be made to one onely God, by his onely Å¿onne IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. For euen as God by his onely Å¿onne hath created vs, &amp; redÃ©emd vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> euerlaÅ¿ting death: Å¿o wil he that to him alone, and by him alone, in whom he is well pleaÅ¿ed, we render thanks for all his benefits. As we Å¿Ã©e how S. <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿etteth this forth vnto vs in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and preciÅ¿ely in the EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ians,</hi> where he Å¿aith, BleÅ¿Å¿ed be God, euen the father of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, which hath bleÅ¿Å¿ed vs with all his Å¿pirituall bleÅ¿Å¿ing in Heauenly things in ChriÅ¿t, as hee hath choÅ¿en vs in him before the foundation of the world: but they which call vpon Saints, and put their truÅ¿t in them, or in their merites, they alÅ¿o which make them patrons and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocates to GOD warde, and likewiÅ¿e they which truÅ¿t in their owne Å¿trength, in their owne frÃ©e will or good workes, robbe God of his glorie, and cannot giue him true thankes for the benefit of redemption. For we cannot giue to any creature, the leaÅ¿t ioy
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:6372:129"/> that may be in the matter of our Å¿aluation: but we commit Å¿acriledge againÅ¿t God the Creator.</p>
               <p>And therefore renouncing our Å¿elues and euery liuing creature, let vs Å¿ay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle, Vnto the king euerlaÅ¿ting, immortall,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17</note> inuiÅ¿ible, vnto God only wiÅ¿e, be honour and glory for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thanks muÅ¿t be giuen, not with the mouth onely: but with the hart alÅ¿o. For, Å¿Ã©eing that God is a Å¿pirit, he requireth a Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of vs, that is agrÃ©eable to his nature: that is to Å¿ay, he will be Å¿erued of vs in Å¿pirit and truth.

For where there is no vnderÅ¿tanding, there is no affection nor wil, and conÅ¿equently no faith, without which, whatÅ¿oeuer we doe, bee it neuer Å¿o faire and glorious before men, it is but Å¿inne and abhomination before God. Let vs take hÃ©ede therefore that in this behalfe we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, and goe aÅ¿tray, leaÅ¿t we be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the IewiÅ¿h people, which honoured and Å¿erued God in vaine, inÅ¿omuch as they came neare vnto him onely with their mouthes,<note place="margin">

               <p>The cauÅ¿e of this miÅ¿chiefe is, for that they haue not yÃ©elded themÅ¿elues to the Church of GOD, for a good end and purpoÅ¿e, as to extoll the glory of God, to Å¿Ã©eke their own Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and the Å¿aluation of their brethren, but rather to make themÅ¿elues greater in their goods and honours, and to Å¿atiÅ¿fie their owne affections. And therefore it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that as Å¿oone as the diuell lifteth vp his hornes againÅ¿t the Church of God, and perÅ¿ecutions be at hand, they melt away by and by in afflictions, as doth waxe before the fire: they are offended, and parched with the Sunne of the croÅ¿Å¿e, they are Å¿orie for the good they haue done, they repent themÅ¿elues that they were Å¿o haÅ¿ty to confeÅ¿Å¿e the name of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in the aÅ¿Å¿embly of the faithful, they wiÅ¿h they had neuer known GOD, nor his word, nor his Church, nor his MiniÅ¿ters, becauÅ¿e they make greater account (as <hi>EÅ¿au</hi> did) of one meÅ¿Å¿e of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,<note n="q" place="margin">

               <p>LaÅ¿t of all, this acknowledging muÅ¿t not onely be priuate, but publike, in the face and preÅ¿ence of the whole Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Dauid</hi> Å¿aith,<note n="r" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, we muÅ¿t not thinke that faith, repentance, giuing of thankes, and loue, and other vertues which GOD requireth of vs, can be perfect here in this worlde: for there will be alwaies in vs, what regenerate and newe borne Å¿oeuer wÃ©e be) Å¿ome remnantes of Å¿inne, of incredulitie, of lacke of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of vnthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; Å¿elfe loue, which is directly contrary and oppoÅ¿ite to the true loue of our neighbour.

               <p>Thirdly, although it be not required of the worthy comming to the Supper, to haue a perfect faith, perfect repentance, perfect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thanks, perfect Loue: yet muÅ¿t they be (notwithÅ¿tanding) true, and procÃ©ede from the heart, and from the Å¿pirit. Our faith muÅ¿t not be feigned, our repentance muÅ¿t not bÃ©e counterfeit and painted, as that of hipocrites: the thanks which we giue to GOD, muÅ¿t not come onely from the mouth, neither muÅ¿t we loue our brethren in word onely, and not in dÃ©ede: but let the whole profeÅ¿Å¿ion of our faith, and ChriÅ¿tian life, aboue all things, bÃ©e farre from oÅ¿tentation and hypocriÅ¿ie, Å¿o that we take more paines to be good ChriÅ¿tians in dÃ©ede, and before God, then to be Å¿o coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken before men.</p>
